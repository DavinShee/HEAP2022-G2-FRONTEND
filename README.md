## Resources used in the project

We used the MERN stack framework [MongoDb Express.Js React.Js Node.Js]. 

We used many different libraries to help us in developing this project. 

1. React-bootstrap: Allowed us to style our site conveniently and create many components.
2. react-pdf-viewer: We spent many hours researching different libraries for a way to display PDFs and many were long and tedious and did not work in the end.
